Review note, 2026-08-29: Home chooses between two outcomes, DocsPortal owns their complete task maps, and Quick Start owns a single executable path.

## Architecture

## Runtime and routes

The site uses Next.js App Router with Fumadocs and exports static files to `out/`.

- `app/(entry)/**` owns `/`, the `x-default` entry that renders the full Chinese home without a redirect.
- `app/(locale)/[lang]/**` owns `/{lang}/` and `/{lang}/docs/**` for `zh`, `en`, `de`, and `fr`.
- `lib/source.ts` loads dot-locale MDX from `content/docs/**` with no locale fallback.
- `app/llms.txt`, `app/search-records.json`, `app/api/search`, `app/robots.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, and `app/og/**` are generated public endpoints.
- Canonical URLs, language alternatives, `x-default`, and Open Graph images are produced by the layouts, document metadata, and `lib/metadata.ts`.

Retired paths are intentionally absent. No application or hosting configuration may introduce redirects, rewrites, or compatibility copies.

## Presentation

`components/SiteBrand`, `components/DocsHome`, and `components/DocsPortal` are the shared shell and entry-point components. `lib/layout.shared.tsx` supplies the same brand, search, theme, language, documentation, and repository controls to `HomeLayout` and `DocsLayout`. Landing and documentation hubs reuse Fumadocs `buttonVariants`, `Card`, and `Cards`; they do not maintain parallel button or card primitives.

`app/global.css` owns the shared contract:

- an explicit centered 72rem shell and responsive gutters;
- neutral Carbon-style layers with the original TianGong plum retained as a solid interaction color;
- light/dark behavior and visible keyboard focus;
- logo plus `TianGong LCA / Documentation` brand lockup;
- low-radius, border-defined controls without gradients, glow, shadow, or lift animation;
- mobile-safe document pagination.

`components/lca-concept-map.tsx` owns the TianGong LCA hero signature. Its abstract reference-data → process-relations → product-system → LCIA-results topology is intentionally different from the TIDAS data-system/schema signature. The `data-hero-signature="lca-concept-map"` marker makes that distinction testable while shell widths, control placement, brand treatment, and accessibility behavior remain aligned between the sites.

The four `content/docs/index*.mdx` sources render `components/docs-portal.tsx` inside the normal Fumadocs document layout. Home states the platform boundary and chooses between two outcomes; it does not duplicate their stages. The portal owns the complete maps: an LCA-study route from goal/scope through interpretation/report, and a reusable-data route from evidence through TIDAS expression, validation, review/publication, and exchange. Each stage labels whether it is methodology context, in-platform work, the external TIDAS specification, or shared platform/practitioner work. Cross-site TIDAS targets use the same explicit locale and link to the specification or validation page rather than copying schema reference content. The current markers are `data-docs-portal-map-v2="two-lca-journeys"` and `data-docs-journey`; the earlier `data-docs-portal="lca-task-hub"` and `data-docs-portal-map="lca-task-route"` remain output compatibility markers.

The four `content/docs/quick-start/index*.mdx` sources render `components/quick-start-guide.tsx` as a category-level first-session route. It is one executable 10–15 minute golden path: sign in, establish the sourced methanol-example context, find any visible open process, distinguish its quantitative reference from a study functional unit, and inspect LCIA method/coverage evidence. Prerequisites, sample limits, step outcomes, completion criteria, recovery, and an optional video make the path usable without branching or requiring video playback. The current marker is `data-quick-start-map-v2="golden-path"` with `data-quick-start-guide="first-session-route"`; `data-quick-start-map="three-stage-onboarding"` is retained only so existing output consumers do not break.

The `overview`, `user-guide`, `data-collection`, `integration`, `openapi`, `deploy-and-dev`, `faq`, and `changelog` roots, plus the nested `data-collection/case-introduction` root, render `components/category-directory.tsx`. Each MDX variant supplies only its locale and category slug. The server component locates the category folder in `source.getPageTree(lang)`, preserves current `meta*.json` order, includes direct pages and folder index pages, and normalizes emitted links to locale-absolute trailing-slash URLs. Titles and descriptions are read from the child page; when description metadata is absent, a bounded first sentence is derived from `structuredData`. Future child-page additions, removals, renames, ordering changes, and copy updates therefore require no category-index edit.

## Content and locales

Chinese is the canonical authoring source. The same logical page uses:

```text
page.mdx
page.en.mdx
page.de.mdx
page.fr.mdx
```

All four variants must change together when structure, links, examples, or user-visible facts change. Locale metadata files follow the same suffix convention.

Screenshot evidence is stored once under `public/assets/docs/<sha256-prefix>/<semantic-name>.png` and referenced through `/assets/docs/**` by the complete locale family. `scripts/check-screenshots.mjs` validates manifest bindings, references, image metadata, privacy evidence, and add/replace/reuse diff semantics. Replacement creates a new hash path and removes the previous asset only when no current MDX source still references it.

## Build and publication

`scripts/build.mjs` performs this fail-closed sequence:

1. validate bounded Node 24, exact pnpm and TypeScript, deployment environment, and source identity;
2. run every Node environment/toolchain/link contract test;
3. run `next build` static export;
4. validate deterministic routes, endpoints, search records, AI index, SEO files, and greenfield deny paths;
5. validate source-locale link topology and every generated local page, fragment, and asset reference with browser URL semantics.

The package graph contains exact local markdownlint rather than dynamic npx installation. GitHub workflows retain reviewed Node `24.19.0`, exact pnpm `11.24.0`, and immutable executable action commits; local Node major `24`, EdgeOne `24.18.0`, and CI `24.19.0` all satisfy the same `>=24.18.0 <25` runtime contract.

The three retained `manifests/p0b/*.json` files are immutable build contracts for information architecture, expected routes, and retired-path denial. One-time rewrite inventories and executors were removed after cutover; Git history remains the audit source.

EdgeOne Makers builds and deploys from Git. The managed Node runtime supplies pnpm, so `edgeone.json` invokes the frozen pnpm install directly without running `corepack enable`; Corepack setup remains a local contributor concern. GitHub workflows validate pull requests and first reconcile any allowlisted deployment against its source SHA and environment-specific indexing policy. Preview stays `noindex` and canonicalizes to production. Only the production origin can start the separate production-environment job that replaces Algolia data and refreshes Context7; preview reconciliation is validation-only.

## Ownership boundaries

- `tiangong-lca-next` owns product behavior, route truth, API semantics, and user-interface behavior.
- `tiangong-lca-next-docs` owns the public explanation and site implementation.
- `lca-workspace` owns the integrated child commit and completion state.
